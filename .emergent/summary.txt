The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the development of the SafeTalk application, transitioning from an initial web application (React/FastAPI/MongoDB) to a React Native mobile app with a Firebase/Firestore backend, as per user's explicit requirements. Key actions involved a comprehensive re-scaffolding of the project structure for React Native, extensive file creation for authentication flows, navigation, core services, and main application screens. The engineer also addressed the critical need for Firebase configuration files, successfully creating them with the user-provided content. A significant challenge encountered was the inability to preview or run the React Native app directly due to dependency conflicts (Node version, Firebase packages), leading to a pivot to a web preview version. Most recently, the engineer is attempting to establish a runnable mobile version by simplifying dependencies and removing initial Firebase integration to bypass the previous issues, prior to re-integrating Firebase fully. The trajectory shows a systematic but iterative approach, tackling foundational setup before deep feature implementation.

<product_requirements>
The SafeTalk application is envisioned as a React Native mobile app with a Firebase/Firestore backend, designed for real-time chat. Key features include: multi-provider authentication (Google, Apple, Email/Password with username, Phone number) with no guest mode; a daily session timer (20 free minutes) that pauses and persists, resetting every 24 hours; a credit system (1 credit = 6 minutes, never expiring, buyable in bundles) that extends chat time; premium user status (unlimited chat, no ads/timer, ability to gift credits, multiple subscription plans); real-time chat with Firestore structure (, ), persistence, rating (after 5 mins/messages), and block/report functionality; anonymous partner matching with a 5-skip limit before a mandatory ad; in-app purchases for credits/premium; and a referral system rewarding both referrer and new user. The application requires full production-ready implementation respecting provided Firebase security rules and Figma UI.

- ** & **: These files were created by the AI engineer based on user-provided content. They contain the Firebase project configuration necessary for Android and iOS builds respectively, linking the app to the Firebase project for services like Authentication and Firestore.
- ****: This file was initially for the web frontend but was significantly rewritten to configure the React Native project with Expo, listing all necessary dependencies for a mobile app. It was most recently rewritten again to simplify dependencies to address run issues.
- ****: This file defines the Expo project's configuration, including app name, slug, and platform-specific settings. It's crucial for Expo builds.
- ****: The main entry component for the React Native application. It was rewritten to integrate navigation and context providers, and most recently simplified for basic mobile run.
- ****: A newly created file, likely a simplified main application entry point to address the mobile run issues, aiming for a minimal working Expo app.
- ****: A temporary or alternative package configuration created to try and resolve dependency conflicts for a simplified mobile version.
- ****: Contains the JavaScript/React Native code for initializing the Firebase SDK with project credentials (though actual credentials are in the platform-specific JSON/Plist files).
- ** (AuthContext, UserContext, ChatContext)**: These files set up React Context API for global state management related to user authentication status, user data (timer, credits, premium), and chat-related information, ensuring data is accessible across components.
- ** (AuthNavigator, MainNavigator)**: Define the navigation structure of the mobile app, separating authentication flows from the main application screens, using React Navigation.
- ****: A comprehensive set of React Native components for all UI screens, including authentication (Welcome, Login, Phone), and main app features (EmptyState, Chat, Matching, Account, Credits, Referral, Settings, Ads).
- ****: Contains the business logic and API interaction (Firebase Firestore) for various features like  (user creation, login),  (managing user data, timer, credits),  (real-time messaging), , , and . These abstract the data layer from the UI components.

The AI engineer effectively transformed the codebase from a web stack to a React Native mobile stack, creating a well-organized directory structure for a complex mobile application, following modern React Native development patterns.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing persistent issues with running the React Native mobile app on Android. After a prior attempt to convert the app for web preview (which was successful), the user insisted on a mobile version. The engineer identified compatibility problems with existing React Native Firebase packages and the Node.js version. To overcome this, the engineer decided to create a simplified React Native version by modifying the core , , and creating a new  file. The goal was to remove problematic Firebase dependencies and establish a working, runnable Expo app base, even if it initially lacks full Firebase integration. This move aims to ensure the fundamental mobile application structure is functional before re-introducing and debugging complex integrations. The last observed action was the successful writing of these three files and subsequent yarn install v1.22.22
